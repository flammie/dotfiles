# Pureline dotfiles

Pureline is a shell prompt beautifier like powerline, but written only in bash.
It's a bit nicer I think. At the moment I use default config but with the
colours it has I'll change it soon. Unlike [powerline](powerline.html) it
actually had a # or $ prompt by default, I only had to write the
process number module showing the history number of current command, this
can be found in my fork here: https://github.com/flammie/pureline
