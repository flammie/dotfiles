# I3 dotfiles


[I3](https://i3wm.org) is the windowing manager I use, it's tiling (occupies
whole screen), so unusable for average windows / mac user. It has lot of nice
configurable shortcuts, the main idea here seems to be that we've taken over the
Mod4 key that is in contemporary keyborads marked by a [broken window
sign](https://www.google.de/search?q=windows+logo) on the keycap. The default
config is mostly good, few changes I've made:

```
# Font
font pango:Terminus 10
```

The default font is some ugly monospace, I use terminus everywhere.

bindsym $mod+Shift+0 move container to workspace 10: 📃
```

By default the workspaces I think are only numbered, I've added nice symbols
that hint how I organise the workspaces, it's possible to use names as well but
these take up a lot of space in the switcher.

```
# multimedia keys
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec xbacklight -inc 7
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec xbacklight -dec 7
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle -q
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer -D pulse sset Master 1%- unmute -q
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer -D pulse sset Master 1%+ unmute -q
```

So the weird extra keys in some semi-old laptops can be made useful too, I'm
pretty sure they are gone in modern laptops and keyboards again so this won't
be of any interest.

```
# passmenu
bindsym $mod+p exec passmenu
```

I use pass to store my password and it uses dmenu just like i3 so it goes
perfectly to bind it to key combo as well.

```
# keyboard changer (buggy)
bindsym $mod+y exec "setxkbmap -layout ru -variant phonetic"
bindsym $mod+Shift+y exec "setxkbmap -layout fi"
```

Since there's no satisfactory keyboard switcher applet that would last for more
than 2 years in the linux world, we have another key binding for i3 to change
the keyboard layout (because also the X version of shift-tab doesn't always
work).

```
# quick pause all noise
bindsym $mod+Shift+p exec "clementine --play-pause"
```

Finally, a boss key for all your open office needs.

## i3bar and i3status

I3's native bar solution and status bar are small enough that I haven't bothered
to write a separate page for them. Mostly also works out of the box, one thing I
have needed to google is all of the non-standard locations stuff in i3status
config, e.g. temperature is read from /sys/ but it's a different place for every
system, the standard is `/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/temp1_input` I have
yet to see a system where it exists. On this laptop I have
`/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon5/temp?_input` one per every CPU
core. So:

```
cpu_temperature 0 {
        format = "🌡%degrees °C"
        path = "/sys/devices/platform/coretemp.0/hwmon/hwmon*/temp2_input"
}
```

At the moment the number after hwmon changes depending on the mood of the kernel
but \* is supported so it kind of works out since only the CPU monitor has temp2
upwards. Originally found the [solution on i3
reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/9t4umz/temperatures_file_path_constantly_changing/).

For everything else, since many of my laptops are mini or rasbpi, I also
condensed a lot of text to unicode emoji or - instead of long words.
