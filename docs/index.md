# Flammie’s dotfiles

This is a quick and dirty documentation for my dotfiles. Dotfiles means
configuration files in unix-style systems. They are in your home directory
(`$HOME` or `~`) and the filename starts with a full stop, that is also called
a dot in some circles.

The dot is omitted [in the git repo](https://github.com/flammie/dotfiles/),
there's a partial script to sync home directory and dotfiles repo as well.

For the following softwares and configurations have “documentation” or a rant
or some such attached:

* [fontconfig](fontconfig.html) and color emoji (2019)
* [mutt](mutt.html)
* [imapfilter](imapfilter.html)
* [vim and gvim](vim.html)
* [i3](i3.html)
* [powerline](powerline.html)
* [mailcap](mailcap.html)
