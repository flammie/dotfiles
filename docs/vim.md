# Vim and gvim dotfiles

Vim is my editor of choice, and it has loads of customisations
and configurations. 

Most important trick for me has been
finding Vundle as *plugin* manager. Since there are a dozen of
different ones out there, I've tried also pathogen but it wasn't really
working for me, Vundle just works with [one-time setup]()
and then just `:PluginUpdate` when you feel like it. Other
nice components are things like editorconfig and powerline, basically
most of the complex config stuff outsourced.
