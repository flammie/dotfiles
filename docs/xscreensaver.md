# Flammieâ€™s dotfiles: Xscreensaver

[Xscreensaver](https://jwz.org/xscreensaver) is the classical screen saver for
linux and X. It has some configuration files (actually uses the `xrdb` stuff),
but mainly it is easiest to configure via the graphical program
`xscreensaver-demo` or `xscreensaver-settings`. If you use desktop environments,
chances are there is a fork of xscreensaver included; it's usually worse than
actual xscreensaver and should be deleted.

More importantly, xscreensaver needs be launched automatically on startup, with
i3 a good place for this is i3's config in `.config/i3/config`. The default
configuration for i3 uses `i3-lock` probably, this can be replaced with just a
call to `xscreensaver &` for basic operation. However this seems to be missing
some powersaving features, perhaps a better way is to use screen lockers, I
haven't found a perfect combo yet, but `xss-lock` with `xsecurelock` seems most
promising so far:
`xss-lock -n /usr/libexec/xsecurelock/dimmer -l -- xsecurelock &`. in i3 config
will work. The configuration of locking times seems to be affected by both
xscreensaver configuration and `xset` settings. Quite unintuitively, the default
settings do not work, I have gotten the following to work:

```
xset s 60 5
xset dpms 300 600 1200
```

This seemingly means start locker in 60 seconds, finish  the dimmer script in 5
seconds(?) then turn off screen in 300, 600 and 1200 seconds (different states
but I wonder if they have any meaning in 2020's).
