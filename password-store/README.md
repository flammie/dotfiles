This is one scary experiment I'd like to do, storing all my encrypted
passwords in the internet. Stupid, I know. If you manage to hack them,
please send me a mail or do something funky with one of the accounts.

As you might guess from the dotfile, it's a standard pass passwords I'm
dealing with. The key, as you might guess, is only on my HD and SD cards,
but not on my android since it'd probably just give it away for free.
