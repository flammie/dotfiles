====================
 Flammie's dotfiles
====================

This repository is for managing "roaming" settings profile of Flammie A Pirinen
For all sorts of Unix-like environments. While the dotfiles generally are too
small and trivial to be copyrightable at all, consider my intent to be that
they are GNU GPLv3, not later or earlier, so distribute, attribute, keep free.
